# Pagination Coding challenge

Create a web page with HTML, CSS (Or Bootstrap), Javascript (or JQuery) and implement a simple dynamic pagination functionality. The data can be a list of books with three properties: bookId, title, and authorName. You can mock the data inside a Javascript object. There should be 20 books and each page should show maximum 6 books/records. The pagination links should not load a new page and must use Javascript to dynamically modify and update the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_document.asp).
